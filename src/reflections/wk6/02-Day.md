how to code

## 1. What are props?
      Props are simply how we pass variables and information between different components. In simple way it works like, define your data and give it a value in the parent component and then pass the value to a prop attribute in the child component.

## 2. What are props used for?
      Props are used in the form of a one-way-down binding between parent and child. The property in the parents component updates and then flow down to the child. But this can not be done in the reverse way.

## 3. Where can props be used or accessed?
      props:{
        postProp:{
          type: Object,   
          required: true
        }
      }
    
    Props Type can be:
    1. String
    2. Number
    3. Boolean
    4. Array
    5. Object
