## 1. What are lifecycle hooks?
      Lifecycle hooks tells us how a library we are using works at the back-end. Basically how a component is created, updated and deleted, everything comes under the lifecycle hooks.

## 2. What are lifecycle hooks used for?
Lifecycle hooks are used for knowing how the component is created, its addition to the DOM, how its updated and finally how the component is destroyed.

## 3. What are mounting hooks? When might you use them?
Mounting hooks are used for knowing how the created component is added to the DOM. In other words, mounting hooks are used for accessing/modifying the DOM immediately before or after the initial render.
