how to code


## 1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
      The main purpose of encapsulation is to hide the data from other programmers or users so that to protect your code from unwanted modifications.

## 2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
      Underscore prefix--> a large number of people ignore the convention which leads to more breaking changes. Closures are more effective in case you want your data to be private.

## 3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?
  To make fields private, just give then a name starting with '#'. With this, it provides a stronger encapsulation, ensuring that your data can not be accessed by any user.
