 ## 1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?
       Wire-frames are a prototype of a page you want to make. A simple layout of what you want and where you want to place the things on your web page.
       wire-frame server various purposes:
       1. Scalability and flexibility: It is easy to update a web site using wire frames.
       For example: If initially your web site is offering 5 products but in few months the production increases to say 50. In these cases wire frames identify the area to update without disturbing other architecture of a web site.
       2. Clarification: Using wire frames first gives a clear idea of how a site should look, what a client wants, where the text will be placed etc.
       3. Saves time: Using wire frames before the actual site development can save a lot of time. It gives the idea of what a client is looking in a site, so client's feedback before site development can be useful.
       4. Quick and Cheap: Making these layouts are easy, it can be made even with pen and paper. 
       5. Painless Iterations: Creating wire frames using software makes the iteration process much easy.

 ## 2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
      The different levels wire-frames are:
      1. Low-fidelity wire frames: This is the very first step of creating a wire frame. It uses rough idea of how a web site should look like. No specific scaling or details are used in this.
      2. Mid-fidelity wire frames: At this level, a more specific idea of how a web site should be is provided. A bit of scaling and more clear idea navigation are provided, but still avoid some more specific details like photo or text.
      3. High-fidelity: In this, a proper view of what a site should be according to the client is provided. It uses proper buttons, navigation, photos and even rough text like lorem ipsum where ever is required. A clear idea is giving about a web site at this level.

 ## 3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
       Yes, Wire frames are a basic layout of what a developer should do while making a web site. If a client has given a proper idea of the requirements are for a site, and a developer creates a site without a making a wire frame, it may differ from what a client actually wants because its all in the mind of a client and a developer but there is no actual layout of there ideas. So if you have a proper wire frame, it also satisfies the clients and gives you an actual idea from where to begin.
