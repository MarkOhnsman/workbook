## 1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

We use Git for the version control of our projects and source code. Version control is important because we can revert back to the previous version if needs be. Additionally, multiple developers can work on the same project without overstepping on each others work using Git.

## 2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
As per my understanding, branching in Git is done to support multiple tasks. Having multiple branches serves this purpose of running multiple tasks simultaneously. There is always one master branch and then corresponding other branches that are diverged from this master branch.
     
## 3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
In simple words, GitHub is an online repository to store multiple projects that use Git for its version control functionality.
