## 1. What is an SSL certificate?
      SSL stands for Secure Sockets Layer--> It establishes an encrypted link between a web server and a browser. The link between the two is private.

## 2. What are the different types of certificates? What are they used for?
      The three types of certificates are:
      1. Domain Validation(DV): This ia a low level encryption which is shown as a green padlock after the URL in the address bar and is the easiest one to receive.
      2. Organization Validated(OV): These provide a medium level of encryption, which includes the verification of domain owner and the legal functioning of an organization. A green padlock following the company's name can be seen by the users.
      3. Extended Validation(EV): These are the hight level encryption which includes the HTTPS,padlock, company's name and company's address in the address bar. 
      4. Wildcard SSL Certificated: One certificate can be used both for domain and subdomain. It can be a cheaper option than the others.
      5. Unified Communications SSL Certificate(UCC): These are same as the EV, the only difference is that these certificates include multiple domains.
      6. Single Domain SSL Certificate: These certificates can be used for protecting only one domain.

## 3. What are some benefits of using SSL certificates?
      The main benefit of using SSL certificate is 'security'. Users want a trusted site to share their information and SSL certificates assures that privacy.
