## What i learned in coding school is...
how to code


## 1. How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
      Scrum for a small team can be more effective as there can be less conflicts while doing a specific task.

## 2. Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
      Sprints act as mini projects of a large project. The main characteristic of a sprint is timeboxing which simply means to limit maximum time a task will take. One sprint at a time means, see the work progress and discuss if something is missing or need to be done. 

## 3. What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
      Unattainable triangle consists of three main things: Quality, Price and Speed, and you can either have one of them but not all of them at once.
      So the idea is, you can aim for 2 vertices of the triangle, but the third one is unattainable. 
      For example,
      if you want a good service at cheap price, it won't be fast,
      if you want a good service and it should be fast, then it won't be cheap,
      if you want a fst service at cheap price, then it won't bt good.
      This is used mainly to set up a balance while working on a project.
