## 1. What is a Github action and how do they work?
      Github actions are event-driven, means that you can run series of commands after that event has occurred and then that event will trigger the workflows. Workflows are made of different actions which run automatically on certain events. Github actions let you create workflows directly to your github repository

## 2. What benefits do Github actions provide?
      There are many benefits of github actions like giving you the information when ever there is a pull in your repository, whenever an event occurs, whatever functionality you want to give that event, it will be doing that automatically. 

## 3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
      The different types of trigger actions are:
      1. Workflow
      2. Scheduled 
      3. Webhooks
      4. External
      Workflows includes actions like pull, push etc. These actions can change a repository in one way or the other. 
      In the same way others like webhooks, scheduled and externals, provides more actions to the repository.
