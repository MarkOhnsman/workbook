# Working in a Professional Environment

**1.** What is Inheritance?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
    Inheritance is a concept in object oriented programming, in which concepts from base class are copied into derived class. In class inheritance, we used 'extends' keyword for the inheritance, which means all the methods from other class gets inherited by the derived class.
    For example:
    class Assignment extends Classroom{}
```
**2.** What is the `Singleton` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
      Singleton is the simplest software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance.
```
**3.** What is the `Observer` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
      Observer design pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between the objects and if one object is modified, it should automatically notify the other dependent objects. 
```
**4.** What is the `Strategy` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
      Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, can select an algorithm at runtime and the code receives a run-time instruction as to use which algorithm. In simple words, each of these algorithms are put in a separate class and their objects are made interchangeable.
```
**5.** What is the `Factory` design pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
      In factory design pattern, the subclasses are responsible for creating the instance of the class. It is also known as Virtual Constructor.
```
**6.** What is test driven development?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
       Test Driven Development is an approach the test cases are developed to specify and validate what a code will do. For example: test cases are created and tested first and if in case a test fails, then only a new code should be written in order to pass the test to avoid duplication of the code.
```
**7.** In Scrum/Agile what is the DoD?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
       The 'Definition of Done' is created by the scrum team and it represents the acceptance criteria for a sprint. It tells what a development team has to cover in order to consider a work done.
```
**8.** Give two examples of a user story:

```
       As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/a value]
       Fir Example:
       As a teacher, i want recordings of my online class to be available to students so that i don't have to worry about the technicalities.

       As a developer, i want to be able to write tests for the project so that to gain confidence in my work.
```
**9.** During which ceremony is your Sprint Backlog created?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
       Sprint planning ceremony. Team gathers and starts to pull items from product backlog into the sprint backlog.
