## What i learned in coding school is...
how to code


## 1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
      For our project scrum is the number one priority. We build a trello board for updating the tasks, figma for the overall view of how our application will look. We used vue.js for building the application, bootstrap, css for styling it, mongodb,postman for the database, Auth0 for the login, googleAPI for the locations.

## 2. What went well so far?
      Everything is working perfectly as decided for our application to work. 

## 3. What would you do differently? Why?
      So for our application, we had two sides to cover, business and client. I worked mostly on the business side, so i have more knowledge about that. Although we discussed each others work and fully understood what is going on, but still at some point i am more confident about the business side.
