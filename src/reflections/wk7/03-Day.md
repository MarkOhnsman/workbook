## 1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
      A user experience or UX is simple an interaction between a business and the people or users. This is more of a ease to access your application experience as what a user wants when accessing your application. 

## 2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
      The UX is providing a healthy communication between an application and the users, whenever making an application, you need to consider the UX as ultimately the application you develope is for the users, what they want should be the priority in making an application. User experience makes it easier for a developer to make an application for the users.

## 3. Why is the User Experience important?
      It is important as if you make an application, and its not connecting to the users, then there is no point of that application because ultimately its the users who will be accessing those applications.
