      Code Documentation is simply documenting your code in simple words so that it can be easily understood by other people and even very useful for you, if in case you want to check something from your previous code.
      Some of the ways are:
      README: It is in sync with the project as when ever you make changes in your code you have to update the README.
      Tutorials: Tutorials are a nice way to teach and learn at the same time.
      Code Documentation in the source: Most effective as it helps in avoiding the mistakes when you write your code.

## 2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
      Among many benefits of code documentation, one main is the readability, as in case, if in future you are stuck in some points and want to recheck, if your code is well documented, it will be easier for you to quickly understand, and the same applies for others too, anyone can understand your code by reading the code documentation.

      Documentation helps keep track of all the aspects of your code and improves your code. By documentation, the main focus is the knowledge transfer from one to many developers.
