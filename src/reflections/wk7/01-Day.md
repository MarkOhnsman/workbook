## 1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
      Pair programming simply means two people writing a code on one machine. One programmer is known as 'driver' which works at the keyboard and the other known as 'navigator' focuses on all the directions, and the programmers should swap roles after few minutes.

## 2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
      Pair Programming has many benefits as using this even the complex codes can be easily understood by sharing the knowledge among the team, as sometimes one team member knows better than the other, so the quality of code can also be increased.
## 3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
      Some of the drawbacks of Pair Programming can be:
      1. If one of the pair is not actively engaged in a task, it will affect the overall performance.
      2. Silent programming is dangerous, so a driver should never be silent.
      3. Developer's ego can be dangerous, as in some cases if both the developers are experienced.
