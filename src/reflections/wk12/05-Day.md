During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

On friday, at least i was not scared, so was improving my project. I used masonry, at i was able to get the results, but not as expected, but i was able to complete all the requirements. In this project, honestly i learned so many things, the most important are how to read what errors are telling you. Now i know lots of errors, how you can get them and how you can solve those errors. I used so many consoles in this project to see if i am going on the right track, with right values and ids.

Final Project: Keeper
