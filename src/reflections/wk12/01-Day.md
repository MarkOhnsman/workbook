During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

As we got this final project on friday, i tried to complete most of my backend in the weekend only, but as i started to see if i am passing the required tests or not, then i realized the backend needs more attention than i was giving it. I worked on the backend on monday, i got stuck with this one test when getting the vaults by profile id. While creating the tables, i gave one of the column's default value 0, which was making one of my tests to fail, but by the end of the day i passed that test.
