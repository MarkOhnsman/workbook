## What i learned in coding school is...
how to code

During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

On tuesday, i was still working on the backend, trying hard to pass all the tests. I was stuck with the private and public part of the tests, where i need to get the vault by id(private & public). At first i was not able to understand the actual meaning of that test, so i was doing hit and trial, putting the id manually, and trying to figure out what it actually means by private. Then after going through the actual pre-tests and what they actually expects from you, i realized that in my code i need to give the authentication also if its private throw and error. At the end of the day, i was able to pass all the required tests.
