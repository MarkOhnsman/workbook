During this final checkpoint simply journal your progress as you build the app. What have you achieved so far, what are you working on now, and what roadblocks are you currently overcoming. Feel free to take this time to express how you are feeling now at the end of the course, reflecting on everything you have learned so far.

On wednesday, i started with the front in vue.js. I was all done with my home page and the modal requirement except for the part where you click on the add to vault button and get a dropdown. The dropdown was not as challenging as to figure out how to get that vault id. I struggled a lot just for getting the right id. But i figured out at the end and realized that what even you what just console it first and see if you are using the right ids in your functions. I also made the basic profile and vault pages and the account page too with minimal functionality by the end of the day.
