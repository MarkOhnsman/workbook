## What i learned in coding school is...
how to code


## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

This course has been a great experience for me. The course is very fast faced and challenging at times, which was again a great learning opportunity for me to brush up my skills and get myself ready for the job market in the US. Honestly, i do not have any concerns with the course. It was a bit 'more' challenging for me specially because since i am very new to the US, it took me a little time to really understand everyone's accent initially and communicate my ideas. For rest of the two weeks, i am planning to come to codeworks on daily basis. The thing that i enjoyed the most about the course was the opportunity to work with different partners. The opportunity to express myself and learn about different personalities at the same time.
