## 1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?
      Inheritance involves a base class that is inherited by a derived class. It is used so that the new class can reuse the base class functionality and if needed modify it accordingly. In C#, a derived class can have only one base class.

## 2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?
Inheritance is performed using different members of a base class. However, not all members of the base class are inherited. The types of members that can not be inherited are - static constructors, instance constructors and the finalizers. 
      
## 3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?
The visibility of an inherited member depends upon its accessibility. Meaning, only the private members are visible in the derived classes that are nested in their base class.
