## 1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
      A portfolio is specifically made to show what you have in your coding, it should reflect your personality, and user experience is important.

## 2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
      It should be simple, but at the same time should be different, and should show your expertise on the subjects/ the languages you are using for the development.
      

## 3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
     For your portfolio, you can make a clone site, some app for family/friends, some app for a local business or something according to your own needs.
     For making a good portfolio from scratch, you can either make a clone site or a smaller but an improved version of a big site.
