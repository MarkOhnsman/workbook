## What i learned in coding school is...
how to code


## 1. Why is communication on a small team important?
      Small team communication is easy to manage as fewer people means its easy to keep track on them and the every one is aware of the responsibilities assign to each other.

## 2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
      Traditional approach has a large scale of projects which are clearly defined even before implementation but there is less involvement of clients, whereas, in agile approach, it consists of medium to small scale projects with interactive input and has full transparency with the clients. 

## 3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
      Unattainable triangle consists of three main things: Quality, Price and Speed, and you can either have one of them but not all of them at once.
      So the idea is, you can aim for 2 vertices of the triangle, but the third one is unattainable. 
      For example,
      if you want a good service at cheap price, it won't be fast,
      if you want a good service and it should be fast, then it won't be cheap,
      if you want a fst service at cheap price, then it won't bt good.
