## 1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
     The three main types of testing are:
     1. Unit Testing--> Unit testing tests individual unites of your code which gives you the confidence that you have a functional and stable code.
     2. Component Testing--> The users have the power to do the test in a component testing. The component tests are the front-end tests.
     3. End-To-End (E2E) Testing--> E2E provides the full coverage of the application, that is, it includes both front and backend.

## 2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
      Unit Testing can be the easiest to create, test and maintain.

## 3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
      E2E is a good testing method but it can be very expensive to maintain and testing the whole system at once can be problematic.
