      2. Customer Satisfaction--> The main goal of developing a software is to give a good user experience. If you are testing your code at the early stages and checking that your code is meeting the actual requirements of what a user want, than your software is good to go.
      3. Confidence--> It is very important for a developer to know if they are going on a right track, and by testing your code alongside gives you that confidence.
