how to code

## 1. What is a List in C#?
      A list holds the variables in a specific order and these are dynamic in size.
      var list = new List<string>();

## 2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
      1. Add method: list1.Add(item);   //adds the 'item' to the List with name list1.
      2. Remove method: list1.Remove(item);    //removes the 'item' from the List with name list1.
      3. Clear: list1.Clear();    //clears/empty the entire list1.

## 3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
      For retrieving a single item fro a list, we can use index method.
      For example:
      Console.WriteLine(list1[2]);
      The output of this will be the 3rd item in the List list1.
